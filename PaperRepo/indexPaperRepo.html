    <td><b>Creating Foldable Polyhedral Nets Using Evolution Control</b><br>
    Yue Hao et al.
    (<b></b>, 
        <a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/1PtwxplWPsX71S7E6QqpXBg" target="_blank">PDF</a>) - 2018.09.15<br> <br>
    <b>Ab:</b>
        Recent innovations enable robots to be manufactued using low-cost plannar active material and self-folded into 3D structures. The current practice for designing such structures often uses two decoupled steps: generating an unfolding (called net) from a 3D shape, and then finding collision-free folding motion that brings the net back to the 3D shape. This raises a foldability problem, namely that there is no guarantee that continuous motion can be found in the latter step, given a net generated in the former step. Direct evaluation on the foldability of a net is nontrivial and can be computationally expensive. This paper presents a novel learning strategy that generates foldable nets using an optimized genetic-based unfolder. The proposed strategy yields a fitness function that combines the geometric and topolocial properties of a net to approximate the foldability. The fitness function is then optimized in an evolution control framework to generate foldable nets. The experimental results show that our new unfolder generates valid unfoldings that are easy to fold. Consequently, our approach opens a door to automate the design of more complex self-folding machines.

    <td><b>An Interface for Assisting the Design and Production of Pop-Up Card</b><br>
    Sosuke Okamura, Takeo Igarashi.
    (<b></b>,

        This paper describes an interface for assisting the design and production of pop-up cards by using a computer. Nonprofessionals find it difficult to design pop-up cards because of the various geometric constraints required to make the card fold flat. We therefore propose an asistant interface to help people easily design and construct pop-up cards. In this paper, we deal with pop-up cards that open fully to 180.  
        
        <ul>
            <li> A pop-up card is represented as a tree data structure. Each node of the tree corresponds to a part and constaints its relative position on the parent part and various parameters.</li>
            <li> The system first computes the card position based on its open angle and updates its center fold line information.</li>
            <li> It next updates the 3D coordinates of the parts on the fold line.</li>
            <li> The system repeats this procedure recursively to determine the 3D coordinates of all parts.</li>
        </ul>

    Edwin A. Peraza Hernandez et al.

    <b>Ab:</b>
        This work proposed a novel model analogous to that for rigid origami having folds of non-zero surface area, which exhibit higher-order geometric continuity (termed smooth folds). The presented results show that the structural response is in good agreement with both experiments and higher-fidelity finite element analyses.  
        
        <ul><li> Rigid origami has been studied by several researchers in the past and the subject remains active.</li>
            <li> The model is divided into kinematic equations and structural analysis equations.</li></ul>
