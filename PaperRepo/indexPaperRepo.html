        Rafsanjani et al. Science Robotics (21 February, 2018)

        <b>Ab:</b>Bioinspired soft machines made of highly deformable materials are enabling a variety of innovative
        applications, yet their locomotion typically requires several actuators that are independently activated. We
        harnessed kirigami principles to significantly enhance the crawling capability of a soft actuator. We designed
        highly stretchable kirigami surfaces in which mechanical instabilities induce a transformation from flat sheets
        to 3D-textured surfaces akin to the scaled skin of snakes. First, we showed that this transformation was accompanied
        by a dramatic change in the frictional properties of the surfaces. Then, we demonstrated that, when wrapped around
        an extending soft actuator, the buckling-induced directional frictional properties of these surfaces enable the
        system to efficiently crawl.

        <b>Ab:</b>Origami robots are created using folding processes, which provide a simple approach to fabricating a
        wide range of robot morphologies. Inspired by biological systems, engineers have started to explore origami folding
        in combination with smart material actuators to enable intrinsic actuation as a mean to decouple design from
        fabrication complexity. The built-in crease structure of origami bodies has the potential to yield compliance
        and exhibit many soft body properties. Conventional fabrication of robots is generally a bottom-up assembly
        process with multiple low-level steps for creating subsystems that include manual operations and open multiple
        iterations. By contrast, natural systems achieve elegant designs and complex functionalities using top-down parallel
        transformation approaches such as folding. Folding in nature creates a wide spectrum of complex morpho-functional
        structures such as proteins and intestines and enables the development of structures such as flowers, leaves and
        insect wings. Inspired by embedded smart material actuators to create origami robots. The design and fabrication
        of origami robots exploits top-down, parallel transformation approaches to achiee elegant designs and complex functionalities.
        In this Review, we first introduce the concept of origami robotics and then highlight advances in design principles,
        fabrication methods, actuation, smart materials and control algorithms. Applications of origami robots for a variety
        of devices are investigated, and future diretions of the field are discussed, examining both challenges and opportunities.

        <b>Ab:</b>The art and science of origami has evolved from aesthetic pursuits
        to design folding structures across cultures and scales. Leveraging origami principles
        allow engineers to fabricate, asembly, store, and morph structure only through bending
        without any cutting and gluing. The resultant origami-inspired structures are featured
        by the capabilities of compact stowing, reconfigurability, and reduction in manufacturing
        complexity. When the origami principles are translated to soft active or programmable
        materials, which are characterized by their remarkable ability to respond to external stimuli in
        a variety of ways, the synergy of the two merits opens up fresh avenues for the development
        of origami-inspired self-folding structures. As one of the sucessful examples, hydrogels,
        a class of soft active materials, have been explored to achieve a substantial number of self-folding
        structures in either a bilayer or a trilayer fashion.

        <a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/1cprAyfoXsZDWiVQLecOQwQ" target="_blank">PDF</a>) - 2018.10.24<br> <br>
        <b>Ab:</b> Based on the mechanism of the negative Poisson's ratio of Miura-ori,
        a new kind of wavy surface is presented in this paper by replacing the polylines
        in Miura-ori with trigonometric curves. This wavy surface not only inherits the auxetic
        responses of Miura-ori in both directions, but also eliminate the corners and creases.
        By applying coefficients and offsets, a model to predict the Poisson's ratio of the wavy surface
        was developed based on the Miura-ori folding mechanism. To calculate the coefficients
        and offsets, least square method was used to linearly fit the parametric simulations
        results on the mechanical properties and the thickness. Although losing the foldability
        in the replacement, the design concept prevides an effective way to construct the similar systems
        by enumerating the origami and tessellations.

    <b>Ab:</b>We present a design method that prioritises in-context design for origami surfaces with periodic tessellations in a parametric CAD workflow using Grasshopper 3D. The key design criteria are: target geometry surface, user-defined folding patterns as periodic tessellations, and fold resolution. Using an error minimisation solver, we generate developable crease patterns from non-developable meshes. We evaluate our method through a study of a target geometry, Fold Mapped with various fold moleculesat variable resolutions, and present a visual analysis as proof of form-fit to the target. This method affords rapid development of origami surfaces, bypassing significant trial and error in by-hand design processes.

    <b>Ab:</b>We introduce SE3-NETS which are deep neural networks designed to model and learn rigid body motion from raw point cloud data. Based only on sequences of depth images
along with action vectors and point wise data associations, SE3-NETS learn to segment effected object parts and predict their motion resulting from the applied force. Rather than
learning point wise flow vectors, SE3-NETS predict SE(3) transformations for different parts of the scene. Using simulated depth data of a table top scene and a robot manipulator, we
show that the structure underlying SE3-NETS enables them to generate a far more consistent prediction of object motion than traditional flow based networks. Additional experiments with
a depth camera observing a Baxter robot pushing objects on a table show that SE3-NETS also work well on real data.

    <b>Ab:</b>
        Origami concepts show promise for creating complex deployable systems. However, translating origami to thick (non-paper) materials introduces challenges, including that thick panels do not flex to facilitate folding and the chances for self-intersection of components increase. This work introduces methods for creating permutations of linkage-based, origami-inspired mechanisms that retain desired kinematics but avoid self-intersection and enable their connection into deployable networks. Methods for reconfiguring overconstrained linkages and implementing them as modified origami-inspired mechanisms are proved and demonstrated for multiple linkage examples. Equations are derived describing the folding behavior of these implementations. An approach for designing networks of linkage-based origami vertices is demonstrated and applications for tessellations are described. The results offer the opportunity to exploit origami principles to create deployable systems not previously feasible.

        Generalized winding numbers provide a robust answer for triangle meshes. In this paper, the authors further generalize the winding number to point clouds.

    <b>Ab:</b>
        Recent innovations enable robots to be manufactued using low-cost plannar active material and self-folded into 3D structures. The current practice for designing such structures often uses two decoupled steps: generating an unfolding (called net) from a 3D shape, and then finding collision-free folding motion that brings the net back to the 3D shape. This raises a foldability problem, namely that there is no guarantee that continuous motion can be found in the latter step, given a net generated in the former step. Direct evaluation on the foldability of a net is nontrivial and can be computationally expensive. This paper presents a novel learning strategy that generates foldable nets using an optimized genetic-based unfolder. The proposed strategy yields a fitness function that combines the geometric and topolocial properties of a net to approximate the foldability. The fitness function is then optimized in an evolution control framework to generate foldable nets. The experimental results show that our new unfolder generates valid unfoldings that are easy to fold. Consequently, our approach opens a door to automate the design of more complex self-folding machines.
