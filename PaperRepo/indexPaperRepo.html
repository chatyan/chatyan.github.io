    Alden Yellowhorse et al.

    <b>Ab:</b>
        Origami concepts show promise for creating complex deployable systems. However, translating origami to thick (non-paper) materials introduces challenges, including that thick panels do not flex to facilitate folding and the chances for self-intersection of components increase. This work introduces methods for creating permutations of linkage-based, origami-inspired mechanisms that retain desired kinematics but avoid self-intersection and enable their connection into deployable networks. Methods for reconfiguring overconstrained linkages and implementing them as modified origami-inspired mechanisms are proved and demonstrated for multiple linkage examples. Equations are derived describing the folding behavior of these implementations. An approach for designing networks of linkage-based origami vertices is demonstrated and applications for tessellations are described. The results offer the opportunity to exploit origami principles to create deployable systems not previously feasible.

        Generalized winding numbers provide a robust answer for triangle meshes. In this paper, the authors further generalize the winding number to point clouds. They propose a tree-based algorithhm to reduce the asymptotic complexity of generalized winding number computation. Armed with a fast evaluation, we demonstrate the winding number in a variety of new applications: voxelization, signing distances, generating 3D printer paths, defect-tolerant mesh booleans and point set surfaces.

        Recent innovations enable robots to be manufactued using low-cost plannar active material and self-folded into 3D structures. The current practice for designing such structures often uses two decoupled steps: generating an unfolding (called net) from a 3D shape, and then finding collision-free folding motion that brings the net back to the 3D shape. This raises a foldability problem, namely that there is no guarantee that continuous motion can be found in the latter step, given a net generated in the former step. Direct evaluation on the foldability of a net is nontrivial and can be computationally expensive. This paper presents a novel learning strategy that generates foldable nets using an optimized genetic-based unfolder. The proposed strategy yields a fitness function that combines the geometric and topolocial properties of a net to approximate the foldability. The fitness function is then optimized in an evolution control framework to generate foldable nets. The experimental results show that our new unfolder generates valid unfoldings that are easy to fold. Consequently, our approach opens a door to automate the design of more complex self-folding machines.

    <b>Ab:</b>
        This paper describes an interface for assisting the design and production of pop-up cards by using a computer. Nonprofessionals find it difficult to design pop-up cards because of the various geometric constraints required to make the card fold flat. We therefore propose an asistant interface to help people easily design and construct pop-up cards. In this paper, we deal with pop-up cards that open fully to 180.  
        
        <ul>
            <li> A pop-up card is represented as a tree data structure. Each node of the tree corresponds to a part and constaints its relative position on the parent part and various parameters.</li>
            <li> The system first computes the card position based on its open angle and updates its center fold line information.</li>
            <li> It next updates the 3D coordinates of the parts on the fold line.</li>
            <li> The system repeats this procedure recursively to determine the 3D coordinates of all parts.</li>

        This work proposed a novel model analogous to that for rigid origami having folds of non-zero surface area, which exhibit higher-order geometric continuity (termed smooth folds). The presented results show that the structural response is in good agreement with both experiments and higher-fidelity finite element analyses.  
        
        <ul><li> Rigid origami has been studied by several researchers in the past and the subject remains active.</li>
            <li> The model is divided into kinematic equations and structural analysis equations.</li></ul>
