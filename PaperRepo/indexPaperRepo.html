        Pengyu Wang, Yuan Gan et al. (2018 <b>Computers & Graphics</b>)
        (<b></b>,) - 2018.11.05<br> <br>
        <b>Ab:</b>We design a novel fully convolutional network architecture for shapes, Shape Fully Convolutional Networks (SFCN). In our approach, SFCNs are trained triangles-to-triangles by using three low-level geometric features as input. Finally, the feature voting-based multi-label graph cuts is adopted to optimise the segmentation results obtained by SFCN prediction. The experiment results show that our method can effectively learn and predict mixed shape datasets of either similar or different characteristics, and achieve excellent segmentation results. 
        The main contributions of this paper include: We design a fully convolutional network architecture for shapes, named SFCN, and is able to achieve effective convolution and pooling operations on the 3D shapes. We present the shape segmentation and labelling based on SFCN. It can be triangles-to-triangles by three low-level geometric features, and outperforms the state-of-the-art shape segmentation. Excellent segmentation results on training and predicting mixed datasets of different categories of shapes are achieved.

        Hae-Do Hwang, Seung-Hyun Yoon (2015 <b>CAD</b>)
        (<b></b>,) - 2018.11.04<br> <br>
        <b>Ab:</b>
        We model developable surfaces by wrapping a planar figure around cones and cylinders. Complicated developables can be constructed by successive mappings using cones and cylinders of different sizes and shapes. We also propose an intuitive control mechanism, which allows a user to select an arbitrary point on the planar figure and move it to a new position. Numerical techniques are then used to find a cone or cylinder that produces the required mapping. Several examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique. 
        The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:
        A simple and effective technique for modeling the bending of a sheet of paper using cones and cylinders; A methodology for the successive application cones and cylinders of different sizes and shapes to produce complicated developable surfaces from an arbitrary planar figure. Interactive control of bending by finding a cone or cylinder which corresponds to a specified displacement by the user.

        (<b></b>,) - 2018.11.03<br> <br>
        <b>Ab:</b>Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format, most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This, however, renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. 
        
        In this paper, we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input. Our network, named PointNet, provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification, part segmentation, to scene semantic parsing. Though simple, PointNet is highly efficient and effective. Empirically, it shows strong performance on par or even better than state of the art. Theoretically, we provide analysis towards understanding of what the network has learnt and why the network is robust with respect to input perturbation and corruption.

        Shuang Shan et al. (2018 <b>CAGD</b>)
        (<b></b>,) - 2018.11.02<br> <br>
        <b>Ab:</b>Cartons are broadly used in the packaging industry and in our daily life. While most traditional packages are axis-aligned cuboids, there is a recent trend of creating paper packages and cartons with more complicated geometries. In this work, we present an interactive system to manipulate 3D cartons from 2D layouts. Two key components, automatic folding and suggestive editing, make our system remarkably easy to use. The automatic folding step computes the 3D coordinates of vertexes i na 3D carton model based on a simple observation. Then, the suggestive editing step determines several geometric constraints, such as vertex merging, merging propagation, and panel pasting, so that users can flexibly manipulate 3D shapes. Moreover, our system supports automatic updating of the corresponding 2D layouts when the user constructs and edits carton shapes in 3D to correct and explore potential layouts.

        <b>Ab:</b>
        A predominant issue in the design and fabrication of highly non-convex polyhedral structures through self-folding, has been the collision of surfaces due to inadepuate controls and the computational complexity of folding-path planning. We propose a method that creates linearly foldable polyhedral nets, a kind of unfoldings with linear collision-free folding paths. 
        
        We combine the topological and geometric features of polyhedral nets into a hypothesis fitness function for a genetic-based unfolder and use it to map the polyhedral nets into a low dimensional space. An efficient learning strategy is used to optimize the fitness function to produce the optimal nets. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method can find linearly foldable nets for highly non-convex polyhedra with substantial complexity. 
        
        The technique presented in the paper will provide a powerful tool to enable designers, materials engineers, roboticists, to name just a few, to make physically conceivable structures through self-assembly by eliminating the common self-collision issue. It also simplifies shape morphing devices. Additionally, our approach makes foldable papercraft more accessible to younger childern and provides chances to enrich their education experiences.

        Aline Vergauwen et al. (2017 <b>CAD</b>)

        <b>Ab:</b> Curved-line folding, the act of folding paper along a pattern of curved lines to obtain a 3D shape,
        is an interesting starting-point for the design of innovative pliable structures. These exists a kinematic
        connection between two surfaces linked through a curved crease that can be used to generate a folding motion.
        However, due to the interdependency of geometry, forces and material properties the design of pliable structures
        based on curved-line folding is very complex. To facilitate the design process, adequate computational modelling
        methods are essential.
        This paper presents two ways of modelling: a geometric modelling mehtod based on discretisation of the crease pattern
        and a method based on Finite Element modelling Analysis (FEA). The proposed methods are validated by means of a case
        study in which a physical model is compared to digital ones. It can be concluded that the method based on FEA
        corresponds very well withthe physical model, proving its potential. The accuracy of the geometric modelling is
        improved by the introduction of a set of guidelines based on the direction of the principal bending moments in the
        pliable structure. Furthermore, the case study exposses how the material-dependent behaviour of pliable structures
        increases the complexity of the design and should certainly be part of future research.

        <b>Ab:</b> In architecture, kinetic structures enable buildings to react specifically to internal and external
        stimuli through spatial adjustments. These mechanical devices come in all shapes and sizes and are traditionally
        conceptualized as uniform and compatible modules. Typically, these systems gain their adjustability by connecting
        rigid elements with highly highly strained hinges. Though this construction principle may be generally beneficial
        for architectural applications that increasingly demand custom-made solutions, it has some major drawbacks. Adaptation
        to irregular geometries, for example, can only be achieved with additional mechanial complexity, which makes these
        devices often ery expensive, prone to failure, and maintenance-intensive.

        Searching for a promising alternative to the still persisting paradigm of rigid-body mechanics, the authors found
        inspiration in flexible and elastic plant movements. In this paper, they will showcase how today's computational modeling and
        simulation techniques can help to reveal motion principles in plants and to integrate the underlying mechanisms in
        flexible kinetic structures. By using three case studies, the authors will present key motion principles and discuss
        their scaling, distortion, and optimization. Finally, the acquired knowledge on bio-inspired kinetic structures
        will be applied to a representative application in architecture, in this case as flexible shading devices for
        double curved facades.

        <b>Ab:</b> When designing packaging machinery, there is a clear need to simulate the action of the
        machine itself to check that it functions correctly. There is also a need to simulate the motion of
        the carton itself during the various stages of the erection process. This is to ensure that unwanted
        interference between faces of the carton net does not occur. This is particularly the case when reconfigurable
        equipment is being used to check that the configuration is correct and to establish what motion control
        is required.
        It has been seen that it is possible to obtain a simulation by handling the transforms applied to the carton faces.
        Reducing the face graph to a <b>spanning tree</b> imposes a hierarchy on the faces and allows the required
        driving motions to be established. The cuts effectively made in forming the tree correspond to dyads in which
        the angular positions of two adjoining faces need to be established. This can be done by imposing constraints
        which say that the edges o either of each cut must come together.

        <b>Ab:</b>Bioinspired soft machines made of highly deformable materials are enabling a variety of innovative
        applications, yet their locomotion typically requires several actuators that are independently activated. We
        harnessed kirigami principles to significantly enhance the crawling capability of a soft actuator. We designed
        highly stretchable kirigami surfaces in which mechanical instabilities induce a transformation from flat sheets
        to 3D-textured surfaces akin to the scaled skin of snakes. First, we showed that this transformation was accompanied
        by a dramatic change in the frictional properties of the surfaces. Then, we demonstrated that, when wrapped around
        an extending soft actuator, the buckling-induced directional frictional properties of these surfaces enable the
        system to efficiently crawl.

        <b>Ab:</b>Origami robots are created using folding processes, which provide a simple approach to fabricating a
        wide range of robot morphologies. Inspired by biological systems, engineers have started to explore origami folding
        in combination with smart material actuators to enable intrinsic actuation as a mean to decouple design from
        fabrication complexity. The built-in crease structure of origami bodies has the potential to yield compliance
        and exhibit many soft body properties. Conventional fabrication of robots is generally a bottom-up assembly
        process with multiple low-level steps for creating subsystems that include manual operations and open multiple
        iterations. By contrast, natural systems achieve elegant designs and complex functionalities using top-down parallel
        transformation approaches such as folding. Folding in nature creates a wide spectrum of complex morpho-functional
        structures such as proteins and intestines and enables the development of structures such as flowers, leaves and
        insect wings. Inspired by embedded smart material actuators to create origami robots. The design and fabrication
        of origami robots exploits top-down, parallel transformation approaches to achiee elegant designs and complex functionalities.
        In this Review, we first introduce the concept of origami robotics and then highlight advances in design principles,
        fabrication methods, actuation, smart materials and control algorithms. Applications of origami robots for a variety
        of devices are investigated, and future diretions of the field are discussed, examining both challenges and opportunities.

        <b>Ab:</b>The art and science of origami has evolved from aesthetic pursuits
        to design folding structures across cultures and scales. Leveraging origami principles
        allow engineers to fabricate, asembly, store, and morph structure only through bending
        without any cutting and gluing. The resultant origami-inspired structures are featured
        by the capabilities of compact stowing, reconfigurability, and reduction in manufacturing
        complexity. When the origami principles are translated to soft active or programmable
        materials, which are characterized by their remarkable ability to respond to external stimuli in
        a variety of ways, the synergy of the two merits opens up fresh avenues for the development
        of origami-inspired self-folding structures. As one of the sucessful examples, hydrogels,
        a class of soft active materials, have been explored to achieve a substantial number of self-folding
        structures in either a bilayer or a trilayer fashion.

        <b>Ab:</b> Based on the mechanism of the negative Poisson's ratio of Miura-ori,
        a new kind of wavy surface is presented in this paper by replacing the polylines
        in Miura-ori with trigonometric curves. This wavy surface not only inherits the auxetic
        responses of Miura-ori in both directions, but also eliminate the corners and creases.
        By applying coefficients and offsets, a model to predict the Poisson's ratio of the wavy surface
        was developed based on the Miura-ori folding mechanism. To calculate the coefficients
        and offsets, least square method was used to linearly fit the parametric simulations
        results on the mechanical properties and the thickness. Although losing the foldability
        in the replacement, the design concept prevides an effective way to construct the similar systems

along with action vectors and point wise data associations, SE3-NETS learn to segment effected object parts and predict their motion resulting from the applied force. Rather than
learning point wise flow vectors, SE3-NETS predict SE(3) transformations for different parts of the scene. Using simulated depth data of a table top scene and a robot manipulator, we
show that the structure underlying SE3-NETS enables them to generate a far more consistent prediction of object motion than traditional flow based networks. Additional experiments with
a depth camera observing a Baxter robot pushing objects on a table show that SE3-NETS also work well on real data.

        Origami concepts show promise for creating complex deployable systems. However, translating origami to thick (non-paper) materials introduces challenges, including that thick panels do not flex to facilitate folding and the chances for self-intersection of components increase. This work introduces methods for creating permutations of linkage-based, origami-inspired mechanisms that retain desired kinematics but avoid self-intersection and enable their connection into deployable networks. Methods for reconfiguring overconstrained linkages and implementing them as modified origami-inspired mechanisms are proved and demonstrated for multiple linkage examples. Equations are derived describing the folding behavior of these implementations. An approach for designing networks of linkage-based origami vertices is demonstrated and applications for tessellations are described. The results offer the opportunity to exploit origami principles to create deployable systems not previously feasible.

        Generalized winding numbers provide a robust answer for triangle meshes. In this paper, the authors further generalize the winding number to point clouds. They propose a tree-based algorithhm to reduce the asymptotic complexity of generalized winding number computation. Armed with a fast evaluation, we demonstrate the winding number in a variety of new applications: voxelization, signing distances, generating 3D printer paths, defect-tolerant mesh booleans and point set surfaces.

        Recent innovations enable robots to be manufactued using low-cost plannar active material and self-folded into 3D structures. The current practice for designing such structures often uses two decoupled steps: generating an unfolding (called net) from a 3D shape, and then finding collision-free folding motion that brings the net back to the 3D shape. This raises a foldability problem, namely that there is no guarantee that continuous motion can be found in the latter step, given a net generated in the former step. Direct evaluation on the foldability of a net is nontrivial and can be computationally expensive. This paper presents a novel learning strategy that generates foldable nets using an optimized genetic-based unfolder. The proposed strategy yields a fitness function that combines the geometric and topolocial properties of a net to approximate the foldability. The fitness function is then optimized in an evolution control framework to generate foldable nets. The experimental results show that our new unfolder generates valid unfoldings that are easy to fold. Consequently, our approach opens a door to automate the design of more complex self-folding machines.

        This paper describes an interface for assisting the design and production of pop-up cards by using a computer. Nonprofessionals find it difficult to design pop-up cards because of the various geometric constraints required to make the card fold flat. We therefore propose an asistant interface to help people easily design and construct pop-up cards. In this paper, we deal with pop-up cards that open fully to 180.  
        
        <ul>
            <li> A pop-up card is represented as a tree data structure. Each node of the tree corresponds to a part and constaints its relative position on the parent part and various parameters.</li>
            <li> The system first computes the card position based on its open angle and updates its center fold line information.</li>
            <li> It next updates the 3D coordinates of the parts on the fold line.</li>
            <li> The system repeats this procedure recursively to determine the 3D coordinates of all parts.</li>

        This work proposed a novel model analogous to that for rigid origami having folds of non-zero surface area, which exhibit higher-order geometric continuity (termed smooth folds). The presented results show that the structural response is in good agreement with both experiments and higher-fidelity finite element analyses.  
        
        <ul><li> Rigid origami has been studied by several researchers in the past and the subject remains active.</li>
            <li> The model is divided into kinematic equations and structural analysis equations.</li></ul>
