        Michael Rabinovich et al. (2018 <b>TOG</b>)

        <b>Ab:</b>
        Discrete orthogonal geodesic nets (DOGs) are a quad mesh analogue of developable surfaces. In this work we study continuous deformations on these discrete objects. Our main theoretical contribution is the characterization of the shape space of DOGs for a given net connectivity. We show that generally, this space is locally a minifold of a fixed dimension, apart from a set of sigularities, implying that DOGs are continuously deformable. We further show how to extend the shape space of DOGs by supporting creases and curved folds and apply the developed tools in an editing system for developable surfaces that supports arbitrary bending, strecthing, cutting, curved folds, as well as smoothing and subdivision operations.

        <b>Ab:</b>
        Reconfigurable mechanisms can deliberately reconfigure themselves by rearranging the connectivity of components
        to meet the different requirements of tasks. Metamorphic and origami-derived mechanisms are two kinds of typical
        reconfigurable mechanisms, which have attracted increasing attention in the field of mechanisms since they were proposed.
        This paper presents an overview of recent developments in innovation design of reconfigurable mechanisms in China,
        including metamorphic and origami mechanisms and their typical applications. The future development trends are analyzed
        and forecasted.

        <b>Ab:</b>
        One-dimensional slender bodies can be deformed or shaped into spatially complex curves relatively easily due
        to their inherent compliance. However, traditional methods of fabricating complex spatial shapes are cumbersome, prone
        to error accumulation and not amenable to elegant programmability. In this letter, we introduce a one-dimensional
        origami based on attaching Miura-ori that can fold into various programmed two- or three-dimensional shapes.
        We study the out-of-plane displacement characteristics of this origami and demonstrate with examples, design of slender
        bodies that conform to programmed complex spatial curves. Our study provides a new, accurate, and single actuation
        solution of shape programmability.

        <b>Ab:</b>
        We discuss the theory, discretization, and numerics of curves which are evolving such that part of their
        shape, or at least their curvature as a function of arc length, remains unchanged. The discretization
        of a curve as a smooth sequence of circular arcs is well suited for such purposes, and allows us to reduce
        evolution of curves to the evolution of a control point collection in a certain finite-dimensional shape space.
        We approach this evolution by a 2-step process: linearized evolution via optimized velocity fields, followed by
        optimization in order to exactly fulfill all geometric side confitions. We give applications to freeform architecture
        , including "rationalization" of a surace by congruent arcs, form finding and, most interestingly, non-static architecture.

        <b>Ab:</b>
        A surface is developable if it can be flatten into the plane without stretching or shearing - piecewise developable
        surfaces are desireable in contexts like manufacturing, where an object might be assembled
        from pieces of, e.g., thin plywood or sheet metal, or milled from a solid
        block using a cylindrical cutting tool.

        We introduce a new notion of developability for triangle meshes which captures two key properties of smooth developable
        surfaces, namely flattenability and existence of straight ruling lines. This definition can be used as a starting point for
        algorithms in developable surface modeling - we consider a variational approach that drives a given mesh toward developable
        pieces separated by regular seam curves. Computation anmounts to gradient descent on an energy with surpport in the vertex star,
        without the need to explicity cluster patches or identify seams. We briefly explore applications to developable design and manufacturing.

        <b>Ab:</b>
        Computational manufacturing technologies such as 3D printing hold the potential for creating objects with previously
        undreamed-of combinations of functionality and physical properties. Human designers, however, typically cannot exploit the
        full geometric (and often material) complexity of which these devices are capable. This STAR examines recent systems developed
        by the computer graphics community in which designers specify higher-level goals ranging from structural integrity and
        deformation to appearance and aesthetics, with the final detailed shape and manufacturing instructions emerging as the result
        of computation. It summarizes frameworks for interaction, simulation, and optimization, as well as documents the range of
        general objectives and domain-specific goals that have been considered. An important unifying thread in this analysis is that
        different underlying geometric and physical representations are necessary for different tasks: we document over a dozen classes
        of representations that have been used for fabrication-aware design in the literature. We analyze how these classes possess
        obvious advantages for some needs, but have also been used in creative manners to facilitate unexpected problem solutions.

        (<b></b>,) - 2018.11.17<br> <br>
        <b>Ab:</b>
        We present a pipeline that allows ordinary users to create deployable scissor linkages in arbitrary 3D shapes, whose mechanisms
        are inspired by Hoberman’s Sphere. From an arbitrary 3D model and a few user inputs, our method can generate a fabricable
        scissor linkage resembling that shape that aims to save as much space as possible in its most contracted state. Self-collisions are
        the primary obstacle in this goal, and these are not addressed in prior work. One key component of our algorithm is a succinct
        parameterization of these types of linkages. The fast continuous collision detection that arises from this parameterization serves
        as the foundation for the discontinuous optimization procedure that automatically improves joint placement for avoiding collisions.
        While linkages are usually composed of straight bars, we consider curved bars as a means of improving the contractibility.
        To that end, we describe a continuous optimization algorithm for locally deforming the bars.

        Our system minimizes or, in most cases, completely eliminates the need for the user to manipulate
        low-level geometry of joints. This is achieved by automatically inferring a small number of
        plausible combinations of joint dimensions, placement and orientation from part geometry, with the
        user making the final high-level selection based on object semantic.
        Through user studies, we demonstrate that functional results with a satisfying appearance can be
        obtained quickly by users with minimal modeling experience, offering a significant improvement in the time
        required for joint construction, compared to standard modeling approaches.

        (<b></b>,) - 2018.11.15<br> <br>
        <b>Ab:</b> We introduce the foldabilization problem for space-saving furniture design.
        Namely, given a 3D object representing a piece of furniture, our goal is to apply a minimum amount of
        modification to the object so that it can be folded to save space --- the object is thus foldabilized.
        We focus on one instance of the problem where folding is with respect to a prescribed folding direction and
        allowed object modifications include hinge insertion and part shrinking.

        We develop an automatic algorithm for foldabilization by formulating and solving a nested optimiation problem
        operating at two granularity levels of the input shape. Specifically, the input shape is first partitioned into
        a set of integral folding units.
        For each unit, we construct a graph which encodes conflict relations, e.g., collisions, between foldings implied by
        various patch foldabilizations within the unit.
        Finding a minimum-cost foldabilization with a conflict-free folding is an instance of the maximum-weight independent set problem.
        In the outer loop of the optimization, we process the folding units in an optimized ordering where the units are sorted based on
        estimated foldabilization costs. We show numerous foldablization results computed at interactive speed and
        3D-print physical prototypes of these results to demonstrate manufacturability.

        Jesse L. Silverberg et al. (2015 <b>Nature materials</b>)
        (<b></b>,) - 2018.11.14<br> <br>
        <b>Ab:</b>Origami is used beyong purely aesthetic pursuits to design responsive and customizable
        mechanical metamaterials. However, a generalized physical understanding of origami remains elusive,
        owing to the challenge of determining whether local kinematic constraints are globally compatible and to an
        incomplete understanding of how the folded sheet's material properties contribute to the overall
        mechanical response. Here, we show that the traditional square twist, whose crease pattern has zero degrees of freedom
        and therefore should not be foldable, can nevertheless be folded by accessing bending deformations
        that are not explicit in the crease pattern. These hidden bending DOF are separated from the crease DOF by an
        energy gap that gives rise to a geometrically driven critical bifurcation between mono- and bistability.
        Noting its potential utility for fabricating mechanical switches, we use a temperature-responsive polymer-gel
        version of the square twist to demonstrate hysteretic folding dynamics at the sub-millimetre scale.

    We segment the object into voxels and search for a voxel-tree that can fold from the input shape to the target shape.
    This involves three major steps: finding a good voxelizaton, finding the tree structure that can form the input and
    target shapes's configurations, and finding a non-intersecting folding sequence. We demonstrate our results on
    several input 3D objects and also physically fabricate some using a 3D printer.

        Zhonghua xi, Jyh-Ming Lien(<b>ICRA 2015</b>)
        (<b></b>,) - 2018.11.10<br> <br>
        <b>Ab:</b>Self-folding robot is usually modeled as rigid origami, a class of origami whose entire surface remains rigid during folding except at crease lines. In this work, we focus on finding valid folding motion that brings the origami from the unfolded state continuously to the folded state. Although recent computational methods allow rapid simulation of fodling process of certain rigid origamis, these methods can fail even when the input crease pattern is extremely simple but with implicit folding orders. Moreover, due to the rigidity requirement, the probability of generating a valid configuration via uniform sampling is zero, which greatly hinders the applicability of traditonal sampling-based motion planners. We propose a novel sampling strategy that samples in the discrete domain. Our experimental results show that the proposed method could efficiently generate valid configurations. Using those configurations, the planners successfully fold several types of rigid origamis that the existing methods fail to fold and could discover multiple folding paths in different homotopic for multi-DOF origamis.

        (<b></b>,) - 2018.11.09<br> <br>
        <b>Ab:</b>Rigid origami is a class of origami whose entire surface remains rigid during folding except at crease lines. Rigid origami finds applications in manufacturing and packaging, such as map folding and solar panel packing. Advances in material science and robotics engineering also enable the realization of self-folding rigid origami and have fueled the interests in computational origami, in particular the issues of foldability, i.e., finding folding steps from a flat sheet of crease patterns to desired folded state. For example, recent computational methods allow rapid simulation of folding process of certain rigid origamis. However, these methods can fail even when the input crease pattern is extremely simple. This paper attempts to address this problem by modeling rigid origami as a kinematic system with closure constraints and solve the foldabiity problem through a randomized method. Our experimental results show that the proposed method successfully fold several types of rigid origamis that the existing methods fail to fold.

We computationally access such manifolds, typically of high dimension and co-dimension, through first and second order approximants, namely tangent spaces and quadratically parameterized osculant surfaces. Exploration and navigation of desirable subspaces of the shape space with regard to application specific quality measures are enabled using approximants that are intrinsic to the underlying manifold and directly computable in the parameter space of the osculant surface. We demonstrate our framework on shape spaces of planar quad (PQ) meshes, where each mesh face is constrained to be (nearly) planar, and circular meshes, where each face has a circumcircle. We evaluate our framework for navigation and design exploration on a variety of inputs, while keeping context specific properties such as fairness, proximity to a reference surface, etc.

        (<b></b>,) - 2018.11.07<br> <br>
        <b>Ab:</b>Origami-inspired mechanical metamaterials have recently drawn increasing attention since their 
flexible mechanical performance has been greatly enhanced by introducing origami patterns to the thin-shell structures. As a typical origami pattern, the waterbomb tube could be adopted to the design of mechanical etamaterials. However, existing designs predominantly make use of the radial expansion/contraction motion of the structure, thereby limiting its full potential to be explored. Here we report a twist motion of tubular mechanical metamaterials based on waterbomb origami that is previously undiscovered. We demonstrate through a detailed kinematic analysis that the initial twist 
is a rigid-origami motion if the corresponding row of the tube under twist is fully squeezed with both line and plane symmetry, whereas all the subsequent twist motion requires material deformation. The twist angle per axial strain and its relationship with the geometrical parameters of the tube are 
revealed. Experimental results show the enhancement in stiffness of the tube with the occurrence of the continuous twist motion. We envisage that this finding could greatly expand the application of the waterbomb tube in the design of origami metamaterials with programmable and tuneable mechanical 
properties.

        <b>Ab:</b>Cartons are broadly used in the packaging industry and in our daily life. While most traditional packages are axis-aligned cuboids, there is a recent trend of creating paper packages and cartons with more complicated geometries. In this work, we present an interactive system to manipulate 3D cartons from 2D layouts. Two key components, automatic folding and suggestive editing, make our system remarkably easy to use. The automatic folding step computes the 3D coordinates of vertexes i na 3D carton model based on a simple observation. Then, the suggestive editing step determines several geometric constraints, such as vertex merging, merging propagation, and panel pasting, so that users can flexibly manipulate 3D shapes. Moreover, our system supports automatic updating of the corresponding 2D layouts when the user constructs and edits carton shapes in 3D to correct and explore potential layouts.

        <b>Ab:</b>
        A predominant issue in the design and fabrication of highly non-convex polyhedral structures through self-folding, has been the collision of surfaces due to inadepuate controls and the computational complexity of folding-path planning. We propose a method that creates linearly foldable polyhedral nets, a kind of unfoldings with linear collision-free folding paths. 
        
        We combine the topological and geometric features of polyhedral nets into a hypothesis fitness function for a genetic-based unfolder and use it to map the polyhedral nets into a low dimensional space. An efficient learning strategy is used to optimize the fitness function to produce the optimal nets. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method can find linearly foldable nets for highly non-convex polyhedra with substantial complexity. 
        
        The technique presented in the paper will provide a powerful tool to enable designers, materials engineers, roboticists, to name just a few, to make physically conceivable structures through self-assembly by eliminating the common self-collision issue. It also simplifies shape morphing devices. Additionally, our approach makes foldable papercraft more accessible to younger childern and provides chances to enrich their education experiences.

        <b>Ab:</b> Curved-line folding, the act of folding paper along a pattern of curved lines to obtain a 3D shape,
        is an interesting starting-point for the design of innovative pliable structures. These exists a kinematic
        connection between two surfaces linked through a curved crease that can be used to generate a folding motion.
        However, due to the interdependency of geometry, forces and material properties the design of pliable structures
        based on curved-line folding is very complex. To facilitate the design process, adequate computational modelling
        methods are essential.
        This paper presents two ways of modelling: a geometric modelling mehtod based on discretisation of the crease pattern
        and a method based on Finite Element modelling Analysis (FEA). The proposed methods are validated by means of a case
        study in which a physical model is compared to digital ones. It can be concluded that the method based on FEA
        corresponds very well withthe physical model, proving its potential. The accuracy of the geometric modelling is
        improved by the introduction of a set of guidelines based on the direction of the principal bending moments in the
        pliable structure. Furthermore, the case study exposses how the material-dependent behaviour of pliable structures
        increases the complexity of the design and should certainly be part of future research.

        <b>Ab:</b> In architecture, kinetic structures enable buildings to react specifically to internal and external
        stimuli through spatial adjustments. These mechanical devices come in all shapes and sizes and are traditionally
        conceptualized as uniform and compatible modules. Typically, these systems gain their adjustability by connecting
        rigid elements with highly highly strained hinges. Though this construction principle may be generally beneficial
        for architectural applications that increasingly demand custom-made solutions, it has some major drawbacks. Adaptation
        to irregular geometries, for example, can only be achieved with additional mechanial complexity, which makes these
        devices often ery expensive, prone to failure, and maintenance-intensive.

        Searching for a promising alternative to the still persisting paradigm of rigid-body mechanics, the authors found
        inspiration in flexible and elastic plant movements. In this paper, they will showcase how today's computational modeling and
        simulation techniques can help to reveal motion principles in plants and to integrate the underlying mechanisms in
        flexible kinetic structures. By using three case studies, the authors will present key motion principles and discuss
        their scaling, distortion, and optimization. Finally, the acquired knowledge on bio-inspired kinetic structures
        will be applied to a representative application in architecture, in this case as flexible shading devices for

        <b>Ab:</b> When designing packaging machinery, there is a clear need to simulate the action of the
        machine itself to check that it functions correctly. There is also a need to simulate the motion of
        the carton itself during the various stages of the erection process. This is to ensure that unwanted
        interference between faces of the carton net does not occur. This is particularly the case when reconfigurable
        equipment is being used to check that the configuration is correct and to establish what motion control
        is required.
        It has been seen that it is possible to obtain a simulation by handling the transforms applied to the carton faces.
        Reducing the face graph to a <b>spanning tree</b> imposes a hierarchy on the faces and allows the required

        in combination with smart material actuators to enable intrinsic actuation as a mean to decouple design from
        fabrication complexity. The built-in crease structure of origami bodies has the potential to yield compliance
        and exhibit many soft body properties. Conventional fabrication of robots is generally a bottom-up assembly
        process with multiple low-level steps for creating subsystems that include manual operations and open multiple

        transformation approaches such as folding. Folding in nature creates a wide spectrum of complex morpho-functional

        <b>Ab:</b>The art and science of origami has evolved from aesthetic pursuits
        to design folding structures across cultures and scales. Leveraging origami principles
        allow engineers to fabricate, asembly, store, and morph structure only through bending
        without any cutting and gluing. The resultant origami-inspired structures are featured
        by the capabilities of compact stowing, reconfigurability, and reduction in manufacturing
        complexity. When the origami principles are translated to soft active or programmable
        materials, which are characterized by their remarkable ability to respond to external stimuli in
        a variety of ways, the synergy of the two merits opens up fresh avenues for the development
        of origami-inspired self-folding structures. As one of the sucessful examples, hydrogels,

        in Miura-ori with trigonometric curves. This wavy surface not only inherits the auxetic
        responses of Miura-ori in both directions, but also eliminate the corners and creases.
        By applying coefficients and offsets, a model to predict the Poisson's ratio of the wavy surface
        was developed based on the Miura-ori folding mechanism. To calculate the coefficients

This work introduces methods for creating permutations of linkage-based, origami-inspired mechanisms that retain desired kinematics but avoid self-intersection and enable their connection into deployable networks. Methods for reconfiguring overconstrained linkages and implementing them as modified origami-inspired mechanisms are proved and demonstrated for multiple linkage examples. Equations are derived describing the folding behavior of these implementations. An approach for designing networks of linkage-based origami vertices is demonstrated and applications for tessellations are described. The results offer the opportunity to exploit origami principles to create deployable systems not previously feasible.

    <b>Ab:</b>
        Recent innovations enable robots to be manufactued using low-cost plannar active material and self-folded into 3D structures. The current practice for designing such structures often uses two decoupled steps: generating an unfolding (called net) from a 3D shape, and then finding collision-free folding motion that brings the net back to the 3D shape. This raises a foldability problem, namely that there is no guarantee that continuous motion can be found in the latter step, given a net generated in the former step. Direct evaluation on the foldability of a net is nontrivial and can be computationally expensive. This paper presents a novel learning strategy that generates foldable nets using an optimized genetic-based unfolder. The proposed strategy yields a fitness function that combines the geometric and topolocial properties of a net to approximate the foldability. The fitness function is then optimized in an evolution control framework to generate foldable nets. The experimental results show that our new unfolder generates valid unfoldings that are easy to fold. Consequently, our approach opens a door to automate the design of more complex self-folding machines.

    <td><b>An Interface for Assisting the Design and Production of Pop-Up Card</b><br>

        This paper describes an interface for assisting the design and production of pop-up cards by using a computer. Nonprofessionals find it difficult to design pop-up cards because of the various geometric constraints required to make the card fold flat. We therefore propose an asistant interface to help people easily design and construct pop-up cards. In this paper, we deal with pop-up cards that open fully to 180.  
        
        <ul>
            <li> A pop-up card is represented as a tree data structure. Each node of the tree corresponds to a part and constaints its relative position on the parent part and various parameters.</li>
            <li> The system first computes the card position based on its open angle and updates its center fold line information.</li>
            <li> It next updates the 3D coordinates of the parts on the fold line.</li>
            <li> The system repeats this procedure recursively to determine the 3D coordinates of all parts.</li>
        </ul>

        This work proposed a novel model analogous to that for rigid origami having folds of non-zero surface area, which exhibit higher-order geometric continuity (termed smooth folds). The presented results show that the structural response is in good agreement with both experiments and higher-fidelity finite element analyses.  
        
        <ul><li> Rigid origami has been studied by several researchers in the past and the subject remains active.</li>
            <li> The model is divided into kinematic equations and structural analysis equations.</li></ul>
